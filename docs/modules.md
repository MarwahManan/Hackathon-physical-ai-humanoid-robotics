# Core Modules of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This comprehensive curriculum covers the essential components of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Each module builds upon the previous one to create a complete understanding of how AI systems can function in the physical world.

## Module Overview

This section is organized into four comprehensive modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics:

1. [**Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**](./modules/module-1-ros2.md) - Middleware for robot control, including ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, and URDF
2. [**Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**](./modules/module-2-digital-twin.md) - Physics simulation and environment building with sensor simulation
3. [**Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)**](./modules/module-3-ai-robot-brain.md) - Advanced perception and navigation with Isaac Sim and Nav2
4. [**Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**](./modules/module-4-vla.md) - Convergence of LLMs and robotics with cognitive planning

Each module contains detailed explanations, code examples, and implementation details to provide a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI systems.
